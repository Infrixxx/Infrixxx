# ü§´üòÆ‚Äçüí® Code Whisperer

**`Code advocate (Innovator / Content creator /Student)`**

I am an aeronautical engineering student, who has a passion for software development. This journey into software development, began on 15 December 2022, when I wondered what would the next step forward be, after being unable to continue my studies due to financial hurdles. I divided into the lustrious world of code and realised that software has great potential to change the society I live in and even the world at large. I took on the journey to bridge societal problems with code, to solve social issues and I am on a lifelong journey to become the best within this field.

  <summary>üë®‚ÄçüíªCode Whisperer 's Coding Journey</summary>
  
  The first time I ever saw code was in 2015, in grade 9, when I was doing IT,at then Northern academy, now Curro. I was learning Delphi and I found myself enticed by how a machine can be interactive with the user. It felt like with every line of code I wrote, it replied and interacted. To be, it felt like I was talking with the computer more than I was coding, thus where I found the term code whisperer, because I believe code whispers to the hardware on what to do and how to do it. I had then stopped coding after I changed schools and the government school I was in didnt offer IT. It was only in 2019, when I went to UCT. That I started coding again, as I was enrolled in a triple major, being applied mathematics, computer science and astrophysics. That is where I was taught in depth, how the machine responds to code, the correlation between math and code. I saw the importance of logic gates, binary code and algorithmic thinking. I then changed schools to pursue a degree in aeronautical engineering at the university of witwatersrand. There I was taught MATLAB along with python. I excelled at my coding course in second year, obtaining a mark of 80+ average. Financial issues occured around the same time as the death of my grandfather and I had to halt my studies. I found myself learning coding through youtube channels like bro code and platforms like freecodecamp. I was lucky to enrol in a sponsored coding boot camp by ALX, where I learnt multiple languages in a 9 month full stack program and a 3 month specialiasation program, where I specialised in back end. I am currently in pursuit of more knowledge, whilst building projects and have created an app through the knowledge to tackle societal issues. I first created it through Kivy and KivyMD, a language I learnt on my own, within a week, specifically for app development. The plan was successful and I had a functional app, but I wasn't pleased with the interface and interaction, so I learnt react to build web apps and react native for mobile apps. I had used google collab to bulldoze the code from kivy and with react, I had used android studio to develop it. It was a success and I am currently, looking to obtain funding for distribution and further development of the app. Some of my projects are available on my profile. I cannot wait for the future and I am grateful for yesterday and now, looking forward to further growth.
